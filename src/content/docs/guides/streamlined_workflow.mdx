## Initial Report Requirements

As with [Drafting Reports](/guides/drafting_reports), there is an
initial set of requirements that the Microsoft Word document (report) must satisfy.

The report must contain:

- **figure or table (artifact) captions**
- **`reportifyr` magic strings**

### Streamlined Report Building

`reportifyr` also offers a wrapper function to streamline and ease report generation 
and report updating. The [Drafting Reports](/guides/drafting_reports) process gives
you sequential control of adding tables, plots, and footnotes in a step-wise
process. However, if this is not necessary, you can call `build_report()` to
perform all of those actions at once:

```r
docx_shell <- here::here("report", "shell", "template.docx")
doc_dirs <- make_doc_dirs(docx_in = docx_shell)

figures_path  <- here::here("OUTPUTS", "figures")
tables_path <- here::here("OUTPUTS", "tables")
standard_footnotes_yaml <- here::here("report", "standard_footnotes.yaml")

build_report(
  docx_in = doc_dirs$doc_in,
  docx_out = doc_dirs$doc_draft,
  figures_path = figures_path,
  tables_path = tables_path,
  standard_footnotes_yaml = standard_footnotes_yaml,
  add_footnotes = TRUE,
  include_object_path = FALSE,
  footnotes_fail_on_missing_metadata = TRUE
)
```

An importante note, if your report already includes artifacts and footnotes added 
by `reportifyr`, this wrapper function will remove them first to prevent duplication.

The `build_report()` function produces the same `reportifyr` draft as [Drafting Reports](/guides/drafting_reports), 
but with only a single function call:

![](/images/add-footnotes-table.png)

![](/images/add-footnotes-plot.png)

### Finalizing a Report

After that, we can remove the magic strings and bookmarks with the same 
`finalize_document()` function:

```r
finalize_document(
  docx_in = doc_dirs$doc_draft,
  docx_out = doc_dirs$doc_final
)
```

Thus streamlining the report drafting process to two function calls!
