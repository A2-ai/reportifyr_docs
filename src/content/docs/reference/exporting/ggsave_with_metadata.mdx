The `ggsave_with_metadata()` function in the `reportifyr` package is an extension of the `ggsave()` function from the `ggplot2` package. It saves plot objects and simultaneously captures analysis-relevant metadata in a `.json` file via `reportifyr`'s `write_object_metadata()` function.

### Returns
