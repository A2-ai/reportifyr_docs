The `save_rds_with_metadata()` function in the `reportifyr` package is an extension of the base `saveRDS()` function. It saves R objects as both an `.RDS` file and as an `.RTF` file via `reportifyr`'s `save_as_rtf()` function, while also simultaneously capturing analysis-relevant metadata in a `.json` file via `reportifyr`'s `write_object_metadata()` function.
