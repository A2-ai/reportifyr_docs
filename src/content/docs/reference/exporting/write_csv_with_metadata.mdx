The `write_csv_with_metadata()` function in the `reportifyr` package is an extension of the `write.csv()` function from the `utils` package. It saves data objects as both `.csv` files and as an `.RTF` file via `reportifyr`'s `save_as_rtf()` function, while also simultaneously capturing analysis-relevant metadata in a `.json` file via `reportifyr`'s `write_object_metadata()` function.
