The `initialize_report_project()` function in the `reportifyr` package creates a directory structure for report generation and ensures all necessary subdirectories are present. If required, it also initializes a Python virtual environment using `reportifyr`'s `initialize_python()` function.

---

## `initialize_report_project()`

<EmbeddedHTML filename="/public/html_files/initialize_report_project.html"/>

---

### Returns

If the following directory structure does not exist within the provided `project_dir`, it will be created: 

<Steps>
1. `report`
   - `draft`: Contains drafts of reports.
   - `final`: Contains final versions of reports.
   - `scripts`: Contains report scripts.
   - `shell`: Contains report shells.
2. `OUTPUTS`
   - `figures`: Stores generated figures.
   - `tables`: Stores generated tables.
   - `listings`: Stores generated listings.
3. `.venv`
</Steps>

If a `standard_footnotes.yaml` is not found within the `report` subdirectory, a prompt stating:

```r
> Copied standard_footnotes.yaml into /cluster-data/user-homes/user/project/report
```

If a `.venv` is not found in the `project_dir`, it initializes one using `initialize_python()` and returns a prompt.

---

### Logging

- **Debug**: Logs the start and end of the function, as well as the creation of certain subdirectories (e.g, `draft`, `figures`, `tables`, etc.).
- **Info**: Logs when the `project_dir` is validated, when `report` and `OUTPUTS` subdirectories are created, and when the standard_footnotes.yaml file is copied over.
- **Error**: Logs and stops execution if the `project_dir` does not exist.
