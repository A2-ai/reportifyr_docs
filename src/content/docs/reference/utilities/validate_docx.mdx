import EmbeddedHTML from '/src/components/EmbeddedHTML.astro';

The `validate_docx()` function in the `reportifyr` package performs a series of checks to ensure that an input Microsoft Word document (`docx_in`) is ready for downstream processing.

---

## `validate_docx()`

<EmbeddedHTML filename="/public/html_files/validate_docx.html"/>

---

### Returns

Any validation failure triggers an immediate `stop()` with an explanatory error message. If the validation is successful, then the function returns silently. 

---

### Logging

- **Debug**: Logs the start of the function.
- **Info**: Logs the `docx_in`, and if the `config.yaml` is missing, `strict` will be set to `TRUE`.
- **Warn**: Logs if disallowed extensions are in magic strings within the `docx_in` or if duplicate magic strings are present whenever `strict` is `FALSE`. 
- **Error**: Logs errors if `docx_in` does not exist or does not have the `.docx` extension, if no magic strings are present in the `docx_in`, if `.venv` or `uv` is missing, and any disallowed file-type extensions or duplicate magic strings whenever `strict` is `TRUE`.
